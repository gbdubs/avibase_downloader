# Bird Region Rosters 

This is a part of a project I'm working on to play around with bird data.
It allows you to input one or more regions, and get back the names of 
all birds that live in that region, using Avibase and Wikipedia as sources.

Avibase's "checklist" functionality has been a good way of determining
the set of birds that may be found in a given region. Wikipedia's use of
inbound links makes it a great source for discovering renames.

Use of this pacakge to do any bulk data collection is strongly discouraged.
