# Avibase Scraping

This is a part of a project I'm working on to play around with bird data.
Avibase has proven to be a really helpful source of well-structured data
and their "checklist" functionality has been a good way of determining
the set of birds that may be found in a given region. Use of this pacakge
to do any bulk data collection is strongly discouraged.
